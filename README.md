# Stylish To-Do List

This is a simple web-based To-Do App for student practice. It includes HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript stub for you to implement the main functionality.

## Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main HTML file with the app layout
- `styles.css` — CSS file for styling the app
- `script.js` — JavaScript file with a function stub for adding tasks

## Instructions

1. **Open the project folder in VS Code.**
2. **Open `script.js` and implement the `addTask` function** using the comments as a guide. Your function should:
   - Read the input value
   - Validate it (not empty)
   - Create a new list item with task text
   - Add complete and remove buttons
   - Add the item to the task list
   - Clear the input field
3. **Style the app in `styles.css`** if you want to customize the look and feel.
4. **Open `index.html` in your browser** to test your implementation.

## Tips
- Use DOM methods like `document.getElementById`, `document.createElement`, and `element.appendChild`.
- Use event listeners for button actions.
- You can use the provided CSS or modify it to your liking.

## Example Features
